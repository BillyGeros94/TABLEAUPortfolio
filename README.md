# Tableau Portfolio

Welcome to my Tableau Portfolio! This repository showcases a variety of Tableau projects that demonstrate my skills in data visualization and analysis. Each project is designed to provide valuable insights and deliver interactive, user-friendly dashboards.

- **Project 1: Fortune 1000 (2024)**

   This project presents an analysis of Fortune 1000 companies, examining metrics such as market value, revenue, profitability, employment, and leadership diversity. Starting with the 
   most valuable public companies, Apple leads with a market cap of over $3.5 trillion, followed by Microsoft and Nvidia, which are also above $3 trillion. Other tech giants like 
   Alphabet and Amazon maintain significant valuations but lag behind Apple. Smaller players like Meta, Berkshire Hathaway, and Broadcom round out the list, with Broadcom being the 
   lowest, at just under $800 billion.

   In terms of revenue, Walmart stands out as the highest-earning company, with over $648 billion in annual revenue, far surpassing other major companies. Amazon follows closely behind 
   with $574 billion, while companies like Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, and UnitedHealth Group post more moderate revenues between $364 billion and $383 billion. Walmartâ€™s dominance in 
   revenue highlights its massive scale in the retail sector, while tech and financial giants lead in other categories.

   The analysis of the largest industries by employment shows that general merchandisers (over 3.1 million employees) and internet services/retailing (over 2 million employees) are the 
   primary employers. Other significant sectors include specialty retailers, commercial banks, and information technology services, each employing more than 1.6 million people. This 
   emphasizes the importance of both retail and tech sectors in terms of providing large-scale employment.

   From a profitability perspective, technology and financials are the most profitable sectors, with profits exceeding $450 billion and $418 billion, respectively. The energy sector, 
   with $240 billion in profits, also ranks high, driven by its capital-intensive nature. Retailing, despite its massive employment, is far less profitable, with only $112 billion in 
   profits, reflecting the thin margins that characterize this industry.

   Finally, the analysis of female CEO representation in Fortune 1000 companies reveals a significant gender imbalance. Only 9.7% of these companies are led by women, highlighting the 
   persistent underrepresentation of female leadership at the executive level. This stark disparity suggests that while companies may be progressing in profitability and scale, 
   diversity in leadership remains a critical area for improvement.

- **Project 2: Forbes Billionaires**

   This comprehensive analysis of Forbes' Billionaires List features several insightful visualizations. Vertical bar charts illustrate the number of billionaires and total wealth across various industries, highlight the top 10 richest individuals, and reveal the countries with the youngest billionaires. Additionally, a map provides a geographic overview of the number of billionaires by country, offering a global perspective on wealth distribution.
  
- **Project 3: Gaming Sales**
  
    This detailed report visualizes gaming sales trends over the years. It includes vertical bar charts that showcase the best-selling genres and top gaming publishers in North America. Additionally, there are horizontal bar charts illustrating the best-selling platforms in Europe. A line chart tracks yearly gaming sales, providing a clear view of sales trends over time.

- **Project 4: NYC Airbnb**

    This project provides an analysis of Airbnb listings across different neighborhood groups in New York City, examining average prices, the number of listings, room types, and the 
    most expensive neighborhoods. Manhattan clearly dominates in terms of listing prices, with an average of $196.9 per night, making it the most expensive borough. Brooklyn follows 
    with $124.4, while the Bronx offers the most affordable listings at $87.5. Queens and Staten Island have relatively lower prices, with Staten Island's average price being just over 
    $114.

    When it comes to the number of listings, Manhattan and Brooklyn lead with over 21,000 and 20,000 listings, respectively. Queens has a more modest presence with 5,666 listings, while 
    the Bronx and Staten Island offer significantly fewer, at just over 1,000 and 373 listings each. This demonstrates that Manhattan and Brooklyn are the primary hubs for Airbnb 
    activity in New York City, likely due to their central locations and tourist attractions.

    Room type prices vary considerably, with entire homes or apartments being the most expensive option at $211.8 per night on average. Private rooms, priced at $89.8, and shared rooms 
    at $70.1, are much more affordable alternatives. This highlights the flexibility in accommodation options available through Airbnb, catering to both high-end and budget travelers.

    The most expensive neighborhoods are also analyzed, with Fort Wadsworth commanding an average price of $800 per night, making it by far the priciest location. Woodrow comes next at 
    $700, followed by Tribeca and Sea Gate at around $490. Riverdale, Prince's Bay, and Battery Park City also feature as expensive neighborhoods, though their prices range from $367 to 
    $442. These areas, particularly in Staten Island and Manhattan, reflect the demand for luxury accommodations in New York City.

    Lastly, the map of NYC neighborhood groups visually breaks down the geographic distribution of listings, showing a concentration in Manhattan and Brooklyn, while Staten Island, the 
    Bronx, and Queens have fewer, more scattered listings. This spatial distribution further emphasizes the dominance of central neighborhoods in the Airbnb market.
  
- **Project 5: Retail Data**
  
    This comprehensive analysis of retail data highlights key trends and insights. Vertical bar charts are used to illustrate the best-selling brands and categories. A bubble chart showcases trends in the most frequently used payment methods, while a line chart tracks monthly purchases. A map visualizes the countries with the highest retail spending. Additionally, a bubble chart displays retail spending according to different income groups.

- **Project 6: World Population**

    This interactive dashboard offers an analysis of global population trends. It includes vertical bar charts depicting the most populated cities worldwide, along with charts showing cities with the highest and lowest population growth. Additionally, a world population density map provides a visual representation of population distribution and density across different regions.
