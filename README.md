- **Project 1: Fortune 1000**

   This project presents an analysis of Fortune 1000 companies, examining metrics such as market value, revenue, profitability, employment, and leadership diversity. Starting with the 
   most valuable public companies, Apple leads with a market cap of over $3.5 trillion, followed by Microsoft and Nvidia, which are also above $3 trillion. Other tech giants like 
   Alphabet and Amazon maintain significant valuations but lag behind Apple. Smaller players like Meta, Berkshire Hathaway, and Broadcom round out the list, with Broadcom being the 
   lowest, at just under $800 billion.

   In terms of revenue, Walmart stands out as the highest-earning company, with over $648 billion in annual revenue, far surpassing other major companies. Amazon follows closely behind 
   with $574 billion, while companies like Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, and UnitedHealth Group post more moderate revenues between $364 billion and $383 billion. Walmart’s dominance in 
   revenue highlights its massive scale in the retail sector, while tech and financial giants lead in other categories.

   The analysis of the largest industries by employment shows that general merchandisers (over 3.1 million employees) and internet services/retailing (over 2 million employees) are the 
   primary employers. Other significant sectors include specialty retailers, commercial banks, and information technology services, each employing more than 1.6 million people. This 
   emphasizes the importance of both retail and tech sectors in terms of providing large-scale employment.

   From a profitability perspective, technology and financials are the most profitable sectors, with profits exceeding $450 billion and $418 billion, respectively. The energy sector, 
   with $240 billion in profits, also ranks high, driven by its capital-intensive nature. Retailing, despite its massive employment, is far less profitable, with only $112 billion in 
   profits, reflecting the thin margins that characterize this industry.

   Finally, the analysis of female CEO representation in Fortune 1000 companies reveals a significant gender imbalance. Only 9.7% of these companies are led by women, highlighting the 
   persistent underrepresentation of female leadership at the executive level. This stark disparity suggests that while companies may be progressing in profitability and scale, 
   diversity in leadership remains a critical area for improvement.

- **Project 2: Forbes Billionaires**

    The analysis reveals that finance, technology, and manufacturing are the top industries producing the most billionaires globally. Finance leads with 366 billionaires, followed by 
    technology with 324 and manufacturing with 323. Other notable industries include fashion with 234 billionaires, healthcare at 204, and real estate at 177. On the other hand, 
    industries such as gambling and sports have the fewest billionaires, with 23 and 25 respectively.

    When looking at the total wealth across these industries, technology stands out as the most lucrative, with a collective net worth of $2.118 trillion. Finance follows closely with 
    $1.647 trillion, while fashion is also significant at $1.494 trillion. The sports and gambling industries, while having fewer individuals in their ranks, also have the least total 
    wealth, amounting to $93 billion and $108 billion, respectively.

    The wealthiest individuals globally continue to be concentrated in tech and finance. Mukesh Ambani enters the list with $90.7 billion, while Steve Ballmer and Larry Ellison follow 
    closely. Other prominent figures include Jeff Bezos with $171 billion and Elon Musk, leading the group with $219 billion, showcasing the vast wealth generated by tech entrepreneurs 
    in recent years.

    When it comes to the youngest billionaires, certain countries have a younger billionaire demographic. Barbados leads with an average age of 34, while Estonias's billionaires 
    average 41 years old, and Tanzanias’s come in at an average age of 45. On the other end of the spectrum, countries like Norway and Kazakhstan have older billionaire populations, 
    with an average age of around 54 years.

    A geographical analysis of billionaires highlights the significant concentration of wealth in certain parts of the world. This concentration of wealth underscores the global 
    dominance of these countries in terms of wealth creation and accumulation.
  
- **Project 3: Gaming Sales**
  
    This project examines global video game sales across genres, platforms, publishers, and time, with a specific focus on Europe and North America. Beginning with genres, action games 
    lead the market with 1,751 million global sales, followed by sports and shooters at 1,331 and 1,037 million sales, respectively. Role-playing games and platformers are also strong 
    performers, while niche genres like strategy and adventure bring in much lower sales, with strategy games being the least popular, at 175 million sales globally.

    The analysis of top-selling platforms in Europe highlights the dominance of the PlayStation 3 (PS3), with 343.7 million sales, followed closely by Xbox 360, at 280.6 
    million. Nintendo Wii and PS also make a significant impact, with over 200 million sales each. Handheld consoles like the DS and PSP feature lower but still substantial 
    sales, while more recent platforms like the PlayStation 4 (PS4) have fewer sales, reflecting its shorter market presence compared to older systems.

    In North America, the top five publishers are led by Nintendo, which has a commanding presence with 816.9 million sales. Electronic Arts follows with 595.1 million, while 
    Activision ranks third with 429.7 million. Sony and Ubisoft, though successful, lag behind with 265.2 and 253.4 million sales, respectively. This underlines the significant 
    influence of traditional gaming giants like Nintendo and EA in the North American market.

    The trend of yearly gaming sales over time shows a sharp rise starting in the late 1990s, peaking in 2008 at 678.9 million global sales. However, after the peak, there is a steady 
    decline, reflecting various factors such as market saturation, shifting consumer preferences, and the emergence of new forms of entertainment like mobile gaming and streaming 
    services. The decline continues into the mid-2010s, indicating a changing landscape in the gaming industry.

    This analysis highlights key insights into the gaming sector, showcasing the dominance of action and sports genres, the long-standing success of certain platforms in Europe, and 
    the considerable influence of well-established publishers in North America. Additionally, the overall trend in gaming sales suggests that the industry has experienced periods of 
    rapid growth but also faces evolving challenges as the market changes.

- **Project 4: NYC Airbnb**

    This project provides an analysis of Airbnb listings across different neighborhood groups in New York City, examining average prices, the number of listings, room types, and the 
    most expensive neighborhoods. Manhattan clearly dominates in terms of listing prices, with an average of $196.9 per night, making it the most expensive borough. Brooklyn follows 
    with $124.4, while the Bronx offers the most affordable listings at $87.5. Queens and Staten Island have relatively lower prices, with Staten Island's average price being just over 
    $114.

    When it comes to the number of listings, Manhattan and Brooklyn lead with over 21,000 and 20,000 listings, respectively. Queens has a more modest presence with 5,666 listings, 
    while the Bronx and Staten Island offer significantly fewer, at just over 1,000 and 373 listings each. This demonstrates that Manhattan and Brooklyn are the primary hubs for Airbnb 
    activity in New York City, likely due to their central locations and tourist attractions.

    Room type prices vary considerably, with entire homes or apartments being the most expensive option at $211.8 per night on average. Private rooms, priced at $89.8, and shared rooms 
    at $70.1, are much more affordable alternatives. This highlights the flexibility in accommodation options available through Airbnb, catering to both high-end and budget travelers.

    The most expensive neighborhoods are also analyzed, with Fort Wadsworth commanding an average price of $800 per night, making it by far the priciest location. Woodrow comes next at 
    $700, followed by Tribeca and Sea Gate at around $490. Riverdale, Prince's Bay, and Battery Park City also feature as expensive neighborhoods, though their prices range from $367 
    to $442. These areas, particularly in Staten Island and Manhattan, reflect the demand for luxury accommodations in New York City.

    Lastly, the map of NYC neighborhood groups visually breaks down the geographic distribution of listings, showing a concentration in Manhattan and Brooklyn, while Staten Island, the 
    Bronx, and Queens have fewer, more scattered listings. This spatial distribution further emphasizes the dominance of central neighborhoods in the Airbnb market.
  
- **Project 5: Retail Data**
  
    This Tableau dashboard provides a detailed analysis of customer purchasing behavior, focusing on spending patterns across different income levels, product brands, countries, 
    categories, payment methods, and months. The visualizations break down various aspects of retail performance to offer insights into purchasing trends.

    The "Spending By Income" chart in the upper-left corner shows how much each income group spends. Medium-income customers contribute the highest amount, at over $178 million, 
    followed by low-income customers at $131 million. Interestingly, high-income earners spend the least, at $102 million, suggesting that the medium-income group is the most active or 
    influential in terms of total purchases.

    The "Best Selling Brands" bar chart in the upper-center section highlights the most popular brands. Pepsi leads with 162,186 total purchases, far ahead of other brands like 
    Samsung, Zara, Coca-Cola, and Sony, which have similar purchase counts, each hovering around 98,000 to 97,000. This indicates Pepsi's strong dominance in the market, with the other 
    brands maintaining competitive but relatively similar performance.

    In the "Money Spent Per Country" map on the upper-right side, the visualization tracks spending by country. The USA tops the list, with $129.7 million spent, followed by the UK at 
    $86.6 million, and Australia with $61.9 million. Canada shows the lowest recorded spending at $61.7 million. These figures suggest that North America and Europe are the 
    most significant markets in terms of spending, with the USA leading by a considerable margin.

    The "Best Selling Categories" bar chart, located in the lower-left corner, breaks down product purchases by category. Electronics is the leading category, with 381,410 purchases, 
    followed by Grocery at 357,248. Clothing, Books, and Home Décor follow, each with over 290,000 purchases, reflecting a balanced distribution of consumer preferences across a 
    variety of product categories.

    In the "Payment Methods" pie chart to the right of the categories, credit card payments dominate, accounting for 90,010 purchases. Debit cards come in second at 76,711, while cash 
    transactions total 73,732. PayPal is the least-used method, with 60,927 purchases, indicating a preference for traditional payment methods like cards and cash.

    The "Monthly Purchases" line chart at the bottom-right shows fluctuations in total purchases by month. The highest purchases occurred in April, with 221,317, while June and 
    November have the fewest, at around 98,000. After peaking in April, the purchases trend downwards, with occasional spikes in August and january, suggesting seasonal buying 
    patterns, possibly tied to sales events or holidays.

    Overall, this dashboard provides a comprehensive view of consumer behavior across various dimensions, highlighting key trends such as the dominance of medium-income spenders, 
    Pepsi's lead as a top brand, the USA's significance in terms of spending, and the strong performance of electronics as a product category. The dashboard also shows a preference for 
    credit card payments and suggests seasonal patterns in purchasing behavior, with activity peaking in April.

- **Project 6: Tech Stock**

    This Tableau project presents a comprehensive dashboard analyzing major tech stocks over the period from 2020 to 2024. It consists of four key visualizations: stock price trends, 
    trading volume, daily returns, and the relationship between market capitalization and P/E ratios.

    The "Stock Price Trend" graph, located in the upper-left corner, displays the historical stock price movements of several companies. Different colored lines represent each company, 
    and the x-axis tracks the date from 2020 to 2024, while the y-axis shows the stock prices. This allows users to observe how the stock prices of each company have evolved over time.

    On the upper-right side is the "Stock Volume" graph, which visualizes the trading volume of the selected stocks over the same period. The y-axis represents the volume of shares 
    traded (in millions), while the x-axis shows the timeline. Each stock is represented by a color, and the spikes indicate periods of increased trading activity.

    The lower-left chart, "Market Cap vs P/E Ratio," is a scatter plot that compares the market capitalization and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of the selected stocks. The x-axis 
    represents the market cap in billions, and the y-axis displays the P/E ratio. Each dot represents a company, with its color identifying the stock ticker. This chart gives an 
    overview of how large a company is compared to its valuation (P/E ratio).

    Finally, the "Daily Return" chart at the bottom right shows the daily percentage return for each stock. The x-axis marks the time, and the y-axis shows the daily return, allowing 
    users to see how volatile each stock has been on a daily basis. Different colored lines represent each stock.

    On the right side of the dashboard, there is a filter panel, allowing users to select specific companies from a list of tickers or adjust the date range using a slider. This 
    interactive feature enables users to focus on specific time frames or stocks for a more detailed analysis.

    In summary, the project brings together stock price trends, trading volume, daily returns, and market cap versus P/E ratio data into a single interactive dashboard that helps users 
    visualize and explore key tech stocks' performance over the years.
