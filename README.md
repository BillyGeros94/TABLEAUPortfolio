# Tableau Portfolio

Welcome to my Tableau Portfolio! This repository showcases a variety of Tableau projects that demonstrate my skills in data visualization and analysis. Each project is designed to provide valuable insights and deliver interactive, user-friendly dashboards.

Contents

- **Project 1: Fortune 1000**

    This Tableau dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of Fortune 1000 companies, focusing on key performance indicators such as revenue, profit, sector performance, 
    leadership diversity, and geographical distribution. Each visualization in the dashboard serves a specific purpose to help users quickly understand different aspects of these 
    companies.

    The "Companies by Revenue (M)" bar chart is used to rank companies based on their revenue, allowing users to identify which companies are generating the most revenue. It gives a 
    clear, high-level overview of company size in terms of income, with the bars representing the magnitude of revenue for each listed company.

    The "Revenue vs Profit" scatter plot provides a comparison between the revenue and profit of the companies. It allows users to visualize the relationship between a company's overall 
    earnings and its profitability. Each point on the scatter plot represents a company, with the placement on the x-axis showing its revenue and the y-axis showing its profit. The size 
    of the points can also give additional insights, such as highlighting companies with higher profits.

    The "Sector-wise Revenue and Profit" bar chart shows how different sectors perform in terms of revenue and profit. This visualization is useful for breaking down company performance 
    by industry, helping users see which sectors generate the most revenue and profit. The chart serves to highlight differences in financial performance across industries.

    The "Female CEO Representation" pie chart is used to present the proportion of companies led by female CEOs. Its purpose is to visually represent leadership diversity within the 
    Fortune 1000 companies, offering a quick and clear view of the gender gap in executive roles.

    The "Geographical Distribution" map highlights where these companies are headquartered geographically. By using a map, the dashboard allows users to explore the geographical 
    concentration of major companies in different states, helping to identify regional business hubs in the U.S.

    Each of these visualizations plays a distinct role in delivering insights related to company performance, industry breakdown, leadership diversity, and geographical distribution, 
    making the dashboard an effective tool for exploring multiple dimensions of Fortune 1000 companies.

- **Project 2: UCL 23-24**

    This project provides a detailed visual analysis of team performance in the 2023-2024 UEFA Champions League. The top-left bar chart ranks teams by points, with Real Madrid leading 
    at 28, followed by Manchester City and Bayern Munich. There’s a significant drop-off in points as we move down, highlighting the dominance of the top teams and the struggles of 
    lower-ranked squads like Red Star.

    The scatter plot comparing "Goals For" (GF) and "Goals Against" (GA) illustrates team performances on both ends. Teams like Manchester City and Real Madrid, positioned with high GF 
    and low GA, show strong offensive and defensive capabilities, whereas teams like Antwerp and Celtic reveal weaker defenses (higher GA).

    The "Team xG" chart on the bottom right reveals expected goals (xG), with Manchester City leading at 24.6, indicating high attacking efficiency. Teams like PSG and Real Madrid also 
    show high xG, while lower-ranked teams like Newcastle and Celtic have much lower values.

    The pie chart summarizes the match results with a large portion of wins, indicating competitive matches. The "GD vs xGD" scatter plot compares Goal Difference with Expected Goal 
    Difference. Teams like Manchester City and PSG are aligned with their expected performances, while Antwerp and Celtic underperform relative to their xGD.

    The European map highlights team representation across countries, with England and Spain having the highest participation. Filters on the left side allow users to adjust the view by 
    metrics such as points, goals, and expected goals, offering flexibility in the analysis.

    In essence, this dashboard combines traditional stats (points, goals) with advanced metrics (xG, xGD) to offer a comprehensive view of team performances, revealing which teams are 
    overperforming or underperforming based on expectations. It’s a powerful tool for assessing strengths and weaknesses throughout the tournament.
  
- **Project 3: Adidas Sales**
  
    The Tableau dashboard provides a detailed overview of Adidas' sales performance in the U.S. across different dimensions. The key metrics analyzed include operating profit, sales, 
    units sold, and product profitability, which are broken down by geography, retailers, and product categories.

    In the top left, the "Profitability Map" highlights the geographical distribution of Adidas' operating profit, with darker shades indicating higher profitability. The states in the 
    Midwest and East Coast appear to have the highest concentrations of profit, suggesting that these regions are key markets for Adidas in the U.S.

    Moving to the middle section, the "Sales" and "Profit" charts track performance over time. From December 2019 to December 2021, both sales and profit exhibit a clear upward trend, 
    with significant spikes around mid-2021. These patterns could indicate seasonal demand peaks or promotional campaigns that drove substantial increases in both sales volume and 
    profitability.

    The "Units Sold" bar chart on the right shows a breakdown of the different product categories, with "Men's Street Footwear" leading in terms of units sold (593,320), followed by 
    "Women's Apparel" and "Men's Athletic Footwear." This data suggests that streetwear, particularly for men, is the top-selling category for Adidas in the U.S.

    At the bottom, the "Retailers" bar chart compares the sales performance across different retail partners, including Amazon, Foot Locker, Kohl's, Sports Direct, Walmart, and West 
    Gear. Foot Locker leads in terms of total sales and operating profit, indicating a strong partnership between Adidas and this retailer. West Gear, despite having high total sales, 
    has a relatively lower operating profit compared to other retailers, which might point to lower profit margins for products sold through this channel.

    Finally, the "Products Profit" chart on the far right compares profitability across different product categories. "Men's Street Footwear" again stands out as the most profitable 
    category, followed by "Women's Apparel" and "Men's Athletic Footwear." This aligns with the units sold data, reinforcing the idea that footwear is a major driver of Adidas' 
    profitability in the U.S. market.

    Overall, the dashboard provides a comprehensive view of Adidas' sales performance, highlighting the dominance of certain product categories, the importance of key retail partners, 
    and the regional distribution of profitability in the U.S.

- **Project 4: NYC Airbnb**

    This Tableau dashboard analyzes Airbnb listings across New York City, broken down by neighborhood groups and various metrics. On the left side, there are several filters allowing 
    users to refine the data based on Neighbourhood Group (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island), specific Neighborhood, Room Type (Entire home/apt, Private room, Shared 
    room), and other metrics such as Price, Availability, Number of Reviews, and Minimum Nights.

    The main visualizations in the center display several important insights. First, the "Average Listing Price" bar chart shows that Manhattan has the highest average listing price at 
    $196.88, followed by Brooklyn at $124.38. Staten Island, Queens, and the Bronx have lower average prices, with the Bronx being the most affordable at $87.50.

    Next to that is the "Number of Listings" bar chart. It reveals that Manhattan and Brooklyn dominate in terms of the total number of listings, with 21,661 and 20,104 listings, 
    respectively. Queens comes next with 5,666, while the Bronx and Staten Island have significantly fewer listings, with 1,091 and 373, respectively.

    At the bottom, the "Room Type Prices" chart shows the price differences across room types. Entire home/apartment rentals have the highest average price at $211.79, while private 
    rooms average $89.78, and shared rooms are the cheapest, at $70.13.

    The "Most Expensive Neighbourhoods" bar chart lists neighborhoods with the highest average prices. Fort Wadsworth leads with an average listing price of $800, followed by Woodrow at 
    $700 and Tribeca at $490.64. These are premium neighborhoods with considerably higher prices compared to other parts of New York City.

    Finally, the map on the right visualizes the distribution of listings across New York City. It uses color coding to show listings by Neighbourhood Group, with Manhattan in dark 
    gray, Brooklyn in brown, Queens in yellow, the Bronx in blue, and Staten Island in light gray. Manhattan and Brooklyn appear densely packed with listings, while other boroughs have 
    more sparse distributions, reflecting their lower number of listings.

    This dashboard provides an insightful comparison of Airbnb data in New York City, highlighting trends in pricing, availability, and the distribution of listings across different 
    neighborhoods.
  
- **Project 5: Retail Data**
  
    This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of retail sales data, revealing insights into customer purchasing behavior across various dimensions such as product brands, 
    payment methods, geographic spending, income levels, and seasonal trends.

    Starting with the "Best Selling Brands" section, it is evident that Pepsi dominates the market with an impressive total of 158,493 units sold, making it the clear leader among other 
    brands. Following Pepsi, Samsung, Coca-Cola, Zara, and Sony showcase substantial sales figures ranging from approximately 95,000 to 97,000 units. This data not only highlights the 
    popularity of these brands but also indicates consumer preferences in the retail sector, which can guide marketing strategies and inventory decisions.

    In the "Payment Methods" pie chart, credit cards emerge as the most favored payment option, accounting for 87,781 transactions. This is followed by debit cards, cash, and PayPal, 
    suggesting that customers prefer the convenience and rewards often associated with credit card use. Understanding these preferences can help retailers optimize their payment options 
    and enhance the customer checkout experience.

    The "Money Spent Per Country" map illustrates the spending habits of consumers across different regions. The USA stands out as the largest market, contributing a staggering 
    $126,573,745 to total sales. Germany, Australia, and Canada also show significant spending, indicating strong consumer markets in these countries. This geographic analysis can 
    inform targeted marketing efforts and product distribution strategies to meet regional demand.

    When examining spending by income, the dashboard reveals that medium-income consumers are the most significant contributors, with a total spending of $173,762,380. In contrast, low- 
    income consumers account for $128,464,477, while high-income consumers contribute $99,751,391. This data can help retailers tailor their offerings and promotions to better align 
    with the purchasing power of different income segments.

    The analysis of product categories further enriches the dashboard, with electronics leading in sales at 372,007 units, followed closely by grocery and clothing. This insight 
    suggests that consumers prioritize certain categories, allowing retailers to adjust their product offerings and marketing campaigns to highlight these popular items.

    Lastly, the "Monthly Purchases" line graph highlights the seasonal trends in purchasing behavior. April emerges as the peak month with 216,219 purchases, while other months like 
    February and September demonstrate lower activity. This pattern could indicate seasonal buying habits, prompting retailers to prepare for increased demand during specific months and 
    to consider promotional strategies to boost sales during slower periods.

    Overall, this dashboard effectively synthesizes key sales metrics and trends, providing valuable insights for retailers to make data-driven decisions regarding product offerings, 
    marketing strategies, and operational efficiencies. By leveraging this information, businesses can enhance their competitive edge and better serve their customers.

- **Project 6: Tech Stock**

    This Tableau project presents a comprehensive dashboard analyzing major tech stocks over the period from 2020 to 2024. It consists of four key visualizations: stock price trends, 
    trading volume, daily returns, and the relationship between market capitalization and P/E ratios.

    The "Stock Price Trend" graph, located in the upper-left corner, displays the historical stock price movements of several companies. Different colored lines represent each company, 
    and the x-axis tracks the date from 2020 to 2024, while the y-axis shows the stock prices. This allows users to observe how the stock prices of each company have evolved over time.

    On the upper-right side is the "Stock Volume" graph, which visualizes the trading volume of the selected stocks over the same period. The y-axis represents the volume of shares 
    traded (in millions), while the x-axis shows the timeline. Each stock is represented by a color, and the spikes indicate periods of increased trading activity.

    The lower-left chart, "Market Cap vs P/E Ratio," is a scatter plot that compares the market capitalization and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of the selected stocks. The x-axis 
    represents the market cap in billions, and the y-axis displays the P/E ratio. Each dot represents a company, with its color identifying the stock ticker. This chart gives an 
    overview of how large a company is compared to its valuation (P/E ratio).

    Finally, the "Daily Return" chart at the bottom right shows the daily percentage return for each stock. The x-axis marks the time, and the y-axis shows the daily return, allowing 
    users to see how volatile each stock has been on a daily basis. Different colored lines represent each stock.

    On the right side of the dashboard, there is a filter panel, allowing users to select specific companies from a list of tickers or adjust the date range using a slider. 
    Additionally, users can filter by closing price, daily return, P/E ratio, and volume. This interactive feature enables users to focus on specific time frames, stock characteristics, 
    or performance metrics for a more detailed analysis.

    In summary, the project brings together stock price trends, trading volume, daily returns, and market cap versus P/E ratio data into a single interactive dashboard that helps users 
    visualize and explore key tech stocks' performance over the years.
