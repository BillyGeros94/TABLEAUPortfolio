- **Project 1: Fortune 1000 (2024)**

   This project presents an analysis of Fortune 1000 companies, examining metrics such as market value, revenue, profitability, employment, and leadership diversity. Starting with the 
   most valuable public companies, Apple leads with a market cap of over $3.5 trillion, followed by Microsoft and Nvidia, which are also above $3 trillion. Other tech giants like 
   Alphabet and Amazon maintain significant valuations but lag behind Apple. Smaller players like Meta, Berkshire Hathaway, and Broadcom round out the list, with Broadcom being the 
   lowest, at just under $800 billion.

   In terms of revenue, Walmart stands out as the highest-earning company, with over $648 billion in annual revenue, far surpassing other major companies. Amazon follows closely behind 
   with $574 billion, while companies like Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, and UnitedHealth Group post more moderate revenues between $364 billion and $383 billion. Walmart’s dominance in 
   revenue highlights its massive scale in the retail sector, while tech and financial giants lead in other categories.

   The analysis of the largest industries by employment shows that general merchandisers (over 3.1 million employees) and internet services/retailing (over 2 million employees) are the 
   primary employers. Other significant sectors include specialty retailers, commercial banks, and information technology services, each employing more than 1.6 million people. This 
   emphasizes the importance of both retail and tech sectors in terms of providing large-scale employment.

   From a profitability perspective, technology and financials are the most profitable sectors, with profits exceeding $450 billion and $418 billion, respectively. The energy sector, 
   with $240 billion in profits, also ranks high, driven by its capital-intensive nature. Retailing, despite its massive employment, is far less profitable, with only $112 billion in 
   profits, reflecting the thin margins that characterize this industry.

   Finally, the analysis of female CEO representation in Fortune 1000 companies reveals a significant gender imbalance. Only 9.7% of these companies are led by women, highlighting the 
   persistent underrepresentation of female leadership at the executive level. This stark disparity suggests that while companies may be progressing in profitability and scale, 
   diversity in leadership remains a critical area for improvement.

- **Project 2: Forbes Billionaires**

    The analysis reveals that finance, technology, and manufacturing are the top industries producing the most billionaires globally. Finance leads with 366 billionaires, followed by 
    technology with 324 and manufacturing with 323. Other notable industries include fashion with 234 billionaires, real estate at 204, and healthcare at 191. On the other hand, 
    industries such as gambling and sports have the fewest billionaires, with 23 and 25 respectively.

    When looking at the total wealth across these industries, technology stands out as the most lucrative, with a collective net worth of $2.118 trillion. Finance follows closely with 
    $1.647 trillion, while fashion is also significant at $1.494 trillion. The sports and gambling industries, while having fewer individuals in their ranks, also have the least total 
    wealth, amounting to $93 billion and $108 billion, respectively.

    The wealthiest individuals globally continue to be concentrated in tech and finance. Mukesh Ambani tops the list with $90.7 billion, while Steve Ballmer and Larry Ellison follow 
    closely. Other prominent figures include Jeff Bezos with $171 billion and Elon Musk, leading the group with $219 billion, showcasing the vast wealth generated by tech entrepreneurs 
    in recent years.

    When it comes to the youngest billionaires, certain countries have a younger billionaire demographic. Barbados leads with an average age of 34, while Brazil's billionaires average 
    41 years old, and Iceland’s come in at an average age of 45. On the other end of the spectrum, countries like Norway and Kazakhstan have older billionaire populations, with an 
    average age of around 54 years.

    A geographical analysis of billionaires highlights the significant concentration of wealth in certain parts of the world. The United States stands out with the largest number of 
    billionaires, a staggering 727. China is the next largest hub of billionaires, with 271, followed by other nations such as Germany, India, and Russia, which have 113, 200, and 112 
    billionaires respectively. This concentration of wealth underscores the global dominance of these countries in terms of wealth creation and accumulation.
  
- **Project 3: Gaming Sales**
  
    This project examines global video game sales across genres, platforms, publishers, and time, with a specific focus on Europe and North America. Beginning with genres, action games 
    lead the market with 1,751 million global sales, followed by sports and shooters at 1,331 and 1,037 million sales, respectively. Role-playing games and platformers are also strong 
    performers, while niche genres like strategy and adventure bring in much lower sales, with strategy games being the least popular, at 175 million sales globally.

    The analysis of top-selling platforms in Europe highlights the dominance of the PlayStation 3 (PS3), with 343.7 million sales, followed closely by its predecessor, the PS2, at 280.6 
    million. The Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii also make a significant impact, with over 200 million sales each. Handheld consoles like the DS and PSP feature lower but still substantial 
    sales, while more recent platforms like the PlayStation 4 (PS4) have fewer sales, reflecting its shorter market presence compared to older systems.

    In North America, the top five publishers are led by Nintendo, which has a commanding presence with 816.9 million sales. Electronic Arts follows with 595.1 million, while Activision 
    ranks third with 429.7 million. Sony and Ubisoft, though successful, lag behind with 265.2 and 253.4 million sales, respectively. This underlines the significant influence of 
    traditional gaming giants like Nintendo and EA in the North American market.

    The trend of yearly gaming sales over time shows a sharp rise starting in the late 1990s, peaking in 2008 at 678.9 million global sales. However, after the peak, there is a steady 
    decline, reflecting various factors such as market saturation, shifting consumer preferences, and the emergence of new forms of entertainment like mobile gaming and streaming 
    services. The decline continues into the mid-2010s, indicating a changing landscape in the gaming industry.

    This analysis highlights key insights into the gaming sector, showcasing the dominance of action and sports genres, the long-standing success of certain platforms in Europe, and the 
    considerable influence of well-established publishers in North America. Additionally, the overall trend in gaming sales suggests that the industry has experienced periods of rapid 
    growth but also faces evolving challenges as the market changes.

- **Project 4: NYC Airbnb**

    This project provides an analysis of Airbnb listings across different neighborhood groups in New York City, examining average prices, the number of listings, room types, and the 
    most expensive neighborhoods. Manhattan clearly dominates in terms of listing prices, with an average of $196.9 per night, making it the most expensive borough. Brooklyn follows 
    with $124.4, while the Bronx offers the most affordable listings at $87.5. Queens and Staten Island have relatively lower prices, with Staten Island's average price being just over 
    $114.

    When it comes to the number of listings, Manhattan and Brooklyn lead with over 21,000 and 20,000 listings, respectively. Queens has a more modest presence with 5,666 listings, while 
    the Bronx and Staten Island offer significantly fewer, at just over 1,000 and 373 listings each. This demonstrates that Manhattan and Brooklyn are the primary hubs for Airbnb 
    activity in New York City, likely due to their central locations and tourist attractions.

    Room type prices vary considerably, with entire homes or apartments being the most expensive option at $211.8 per night on average. Private rooms, priced at $89.8, and shared rooms 
    at $70.1, are much more affordable alternatives. This highlights the flexibility in accommodation options available through Airbnb, catering to both high-end and budget travelers.

    The most expensive neighborhoods are also analyzed, with Fort Wadsworth commanding an average price of $800 per night, making it by far the priciest location. Woodrow comes next at 
    $700, followed by Tribeca and Sea Gate at around $490. Riverdale, Prince's Bay, and Battery Park City also feature as expensive neighborhoods, though their prices range from $367 to 
    $442. These areas, particularly in Staten Island and Manhattan, reflect the demand for luxury accommodations in New York City.

    Lastly, the map of NYC neighborhood groups visually breaks down the geographic distribution of listings, showing a concentration in Manhattan and Brooklyn, while Staten Island, the 
    Bronx, and Queens have fewer, more scattered listings. This spatial distribution further emphasizes the dominance of central neighborhoods in the Airbnb market.
  
- **Project 5: Retail Data**
  
    Consumer spending patterns vary significantly by income, with medium-income earners contributing the largest share of total spending at $178 million. Low-income earners follow with 
    $131 million, while high-income earners contribute the least at $102 million. The brand preferences of consumers show Pepsi as the most popular brand with 162,186 purchases, far 
    ahead of other top brands like Samsung (98,796 purchases), Zara (98,327), Coca-Cola (98,281), and Sony (97,995).

    The geographical distribution of spending shows that the United States leads with $129.7 million in total expenditures. The UK follows with $86.6 million, Canada with $61.7 
    million, and Australia with $61.9 million. In terms of product categories, electronics is the dominant category with 381,410 purchases, followed by groceries at 357,248. Clothing 
    (293,529), books (292,075), and home decor (291,014) are also popular categories among consumers.

    When it comes to payment methods, credit cards are the preferred choice, with 90,010 purchases. Debit cards are close behind with 76,711, while cash transactions account for 73,732 
    purchases. PayPal remains a popular digital payment option with 60,927 purchases. Monthly purchase patterns fluctuate throughout the year, peaking in March with 221,137 purchases 
    and February with 198,778. The lowest spending occurs in January (98,147), with relatively consistent purchase behavior seen from June through December.

- **Project 6: World Population**

    This interactive dashboard offers an analysis of global population trends. Tokyo holds the position as the most populous city in 2024, boasting a staggering population of 37.1 
    million. Following closely behind is Delhi, with 33.8 million residents, making it one of the largest cities in the world. Shanghai, the economic powerhouse of China, ranks third 
    with a population of 29.8 million people. Other highly populated urban centers include Dhaka (23.9 million), the capital of Bangladesh, São Paulo (22.8 million), the largest city 
    in Brazil, Cairo (22.6 million) in Egypt, and Mexico City (22.5 million), which continues to be one of the largest cities in Latin America.

    When examining population growth rates, Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi, tops the list with an impressive growth rate of 6.52%, indicating rapid urbanization. Other African 
    cities such as Lokola (5.85%) and Bunia (5.45%) also show significant growth, reflecting broader trends of population expansion in certain parts of Africa. Kampala, Uganda’s 
    capital, follows with a growth rate of 5.32%, while Aleppo, despite facing the challenges of post-war recovery, exhibits a population growth rate of 5.2%.

    On the opposite side, several cities in the Western world are experiencing population decline. New York City leads this trend, with a negative growth rate of -2.49%, signaling 
    ongoing issues like suburbanization and possibly economic factors influencing migration. Chicago follows with a decrease of -1.43%, while Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Beirut 
    round out the cities with the steepest declines in population, all showing negative growth rates ranging from -1.07% to -0.78%.

    The global population density map reveals that the most densely populated areas are concentrated in East and South Asia, specifically in countries like China, India, and 
    Bangladesh. There is also notable population density in parts of Africa, especially in regions experiencing high growth rates, and throughout parts of Europe. Meanwhile, population 
    density is lower in regions such as North America, Australia, and certain parts of South America, where urban centers are more sparsely spread and overall populations are lower.

    This data highlights the ongoing trends of urban expansion in developing regions, especially in Africa and parts of Asia, while some of the world's largest and most developed 
    cities face population stagnation or decline due to various economic, social, and migratory factors.
